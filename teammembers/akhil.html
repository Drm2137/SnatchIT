            <h2>As an Integration Specialist, I developed a custom browser extension to streamline and enhance user workflows by seamlessly bridging web-based applications with internal systems. The extension was designed to interact with specific APIs, capture contextual data directly from the browser, and trigger automated actionsâ€”significantly reducing manual input and improving data consistency. I ensured secure authentication, efficient data handling, and a user-friendly interface, all while aligning the tool with business objectives and technical constraints. This initiative not only improved operational efficiency but also exemplified how thoughtful integration can create meaningful, user-centric solutions</h2>
