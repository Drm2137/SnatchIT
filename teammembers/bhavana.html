    <h2> Reflections</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>GitHub Issues</h3>
      <p>From learning about GitHub Issues, I understood how they help in tracking bugs, tasks, and feature requests, making it easier to manage and collaborate on projects effectively.</p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How can you link Issues to Pull Requests?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong>You can link Issues to Pull Requests by mentioning the Issue number in the PR description using keywords like Fixes #issue-number. Once the PR is merged, the linked Issue is automatically closed.</p>
    </article>

      <h3>CLI Learns</h3>
      <p>I learned how to use the CLI to interact with Git and GitHub efficiently, performing tasks like commits, branches, and pushes through terminal commands.

</p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you switch between branches using the CLI?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> You can switch between branches using the command git checkout branch-name. In newer Git versions, you can also use git switch branch-name for better readability.</p>

    <h2>üßπ Tidy First? Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Kent Beck‚Äôs <strong>Tidy First?</strong> is a philosophy about improving code by making small, safe changes before adding new functionality. These changes might include renaming variables, splitting large functions, or reorganizing structure‚Äîall without altering what the code does.</p>
    <p>The focus isn‚Äôt on achieving perfection but on clearing the path for your next step. By tidying first, developers can make progress more smoothly and confidently.</p>
    <p>Beck emphasizes that design should evolve naturally based on the needs that arise during development‚Äînot overengineered in advance. The key ideas are:</p>
    <ul style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 30px; text-align: left;">
        <li>Keep code simple and understandable</li>
        <li>Stay adaptable as requirements change</li>
        <li>Continuously tidy up instead of waiting for a big refactor</li>
    </ul>
